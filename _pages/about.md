Farah is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) Division at Argonne National Laboratory, where her research focuses on evaluating the energy efficiency of AI accelerators used in machine learning applications. This includes GPUs from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, as well as specialized AI accelerators like Intel Habana Gaudi, Graphcore, Groq, and others. She works on multiple projects that benchmark the power and performance of deep learning models across different AI hardware platforms. 

<!--She earned her Ph.D. in Fall 2022 from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Florida International University and her M.Sc. in Fall 2018 from the University of New Hampshire. Earlier, Farah received her B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in September 2015. Before starting her graduate studies, Farah worked as an electrical safety engineer at Stichting Bangladesh Accord Foundation for a year and a half.-->

She has published numerous scientific articles, including journal articles, conference papers, and book chapters on esteemed platforms. Her research is showcased in premier ACM/IEEE journals and conferences, such as the SC Workshops of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, IEEE International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Internet Computing (CCGrid), IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS), ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems, IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC), and IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems (TVLSI). Her research interests include high-performance computer architecture, energy-efficient computing, hardware security, cybersecurity, and memory systems. Her PhD research specifically focused on hardware security and emerging memory technologies.
