True random number generation (TRNG) plays an important role in security applications and protocols. In this article, we propose an effective technique to generate a robust true random number using emerging, energy-efficient, nonvolatile, consumer-off-the-shelf (COTS) ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) chips. In the proposed method, we extract inherent randomness from internal ferroelectric capacitors by exploiting latency variation across cells within FRAM. Hardware results and subsequent National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) statistical test suite (STS) testing indicate that the proposed latency-based TRNG is robust over a wide range of operating conditions at speeds of 6.23 Mb/s using COTS, silicon FRAM chips from Cypress Semiconductor Corporation.
