Memory chips play a critical role in performance and energy because they are the fundamental bottlenecks in computing systems. Several emerging memory chips such as Magneto-resistive Random-Access Memory (MRAM), Resistive RAM (ReRAM), Phase-Change Memory (PCM), and Ferroelectric RAM (FRAM) have been proposed to replace mainstream memory chips to overcome the limitations of the existing memory chips such as high leakage current, a large amount of energy consumption, lack of scalability, etc. These emerging memory chips possess several advantageous features such as non-volatility, high density, scalability, long endurance, ultralow-power operation, read/write current asymmetry, high write current, etc. However, some of these new exclusive features in the emerging memory device and architecture may introduce new vulnerabilities that can be detrimental for security and safety. This chapter will focus on the security vulnerabilities of emerging non-volatile memory chips and discuss the existing countermeasures to make the computing systems robust against various attacks.
